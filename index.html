        <h1><span>Hi, my name is Ruben Rodriguez</span></h1>
        <p>
            I am recent graduate from the University of Texas
            at Dallas, and I am interested in web development. hence I am currently
            taking this course to improve my skills.</p>

        <p>
            My goal is to finish this course and a few more courses I have taken this semester
            to then add some project in my GitHub repository so that I can increase
            my chances of landing a job, which then I want to build up and to
            one day be able to work in a company called
            <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/about/who" target="_blank"> Cruncyroll</a>
        </p>
        <p id="side-note">
            I am also a professional photographer in Dallas, Texas. my professional goal
            in this manner is that I am building a photography portfolio to later receive
            higher level clients such as business owners, lawyers, professional events to
            also achieve my goal of turning this side hustle to a company with studio equipment
            to take photos and to have a continues revenue in a hobby that I like.
