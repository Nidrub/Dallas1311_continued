      I am recent graduate from the University of Texas
      at Dallas, and I am interested in web development. hence I am currently
      taking this course to improve my skills.</p>

    <p>
      My goal is to finish this course and a few more courses I have taken this semester
      to then add some project in my GitHub repository so that I can increase
      my chances of landing a job, which then I want to build up and to
      one day be able to work in a company called
      <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/about/who" target="_blank"> Cruncyroll</a>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>
      When taking ITSE-1311 I learned to used techniques such as JQuery and he different functionalities that it
      offers, such as append, remove and the manipulation of the DOM, which is heavily used in front end development
      and in technologies such as Spring Boot and Angular.
    </p>
    <h2>How It Helps My Goals</h2>
    <p>
      What I learned in this class will help with front end development and make it easier to develop,
      now knowing the different tools that JavaScript, HTML, and CSS offer, and that I can start developing
      front end projects using what I have learned in this class.
